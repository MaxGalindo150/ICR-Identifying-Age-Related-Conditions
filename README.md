# ICR-Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions
The objective of this notebook is to create a model to predict whether a person has none (Class 0) or any of three medical conditions (Class 1). We are going to try to solve the problem by building a Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests on our dataset ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions.
